    <h1>Chicken Pizza</h1>

    <img src="../images/chicken-pizza.jpg" alt="chicken-pizza-pic">

    <h3>Origin</h3>

    <p>The word pizza was first documented in 997 AD in Gaeta[3] and successively in different parts of Central and Southern Italy. Pizza was mainly eaten in Italy and by emigrants from there. This changed after World War II when Allied troops stationed in Italy came to enjoy pizza along with other Italian foods.</p>

    <p>In Sardinia, French and Italian archaeologists have found bread baked over 7,000 years ago. According to Philippe Marinval, the local islanders leavened this bread</p>
