    <h1>Chicken Noodles</h1>

    <img src="../images/chicken-noodles.jpg" alt="chicken-noodles-pic">

    <h3>Origin</h3>

    <p>The earliest written record of noodles is found in a book dated to the Eastern Han period (25–220 CE).[2] Noodles made from wheat dough became a prominent food for the people of the Han dynasty.</p>

    <p>The oldest evidence of noodles was from 4,000 years ago in China.[2] In 2005, a team of archaeologists reported finding an earthenware bowl that contained 4000-year-old noodles at the Lajia archaeological site.[4] These noodles were said to resemble lamian, a type of Chinese noodle.</p>

    <h3>Ingridents</h3>

    <ul>

        <li>4 boned, skinned chicken breast halves (5 to 6 oz. each)</li>

        <li>1 pound fresh Asian-style noodles
        </li>

        <li>2 tablespoons salad oil</li>

        <li>1 onion (about 8 oz.), peeled and thinly sliced</li>

        <li>¼ cup chopped green onions (including tops)</li>

        <li>¼ cup minced garlic</li>

        <li>½ cup rice wine</li>

        <li>¼ cup rice vinegar</li>

        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps To Prepare</h3>

    <ol>

        <li>Rinse chicken and pat dry. Cut breast halves crosswise into 1/8-inch-wide strips.</li>

        <li>In a 5- to 6-quart pan over high heat, bring about 4 quarts water to a boil; add noodles and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender to bite, about 3 minutes. Drain noodles and return to pan.</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, pour oil into a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add onion, mushrooms, green onions, and garlic; stir often until onion and mushrooms begin to brown, about 8 minutes. Add chicken and stir often until no longer pink in the center (cut to test), about 3 minutes. Add rice wine, vinegar, and soy sauce; cook to blend flavors, 1 to 2 minutes longer.</li>

        <li>Add chicken mixture to noodles in pan and stir over medium-high heat until hot, 2 to 3 minutes. Divide equally among four wide bowls.</li>

    </ol>
