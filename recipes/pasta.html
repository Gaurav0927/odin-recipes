    <h4>History</h4>

    <p>The first concrete information on pasta products in Italy dates to the 13th or 14th centuries.[9] In the 1st century AD writings of Horace, lagana (singular: laganum) were fine sheets of fried dough[10] and were an everyday foodstuff.[11] Writing in the 2nd century, Athenaeus of Naucratis provides a recipe for lagana which he attributes to the 1st century Chrysippus of Tyana: sheets of dough made of wheat flour and the juice of crushed lettuce, then flavoured with spices and deep-fried in oil.</p>

    <p>An early 5th century cookbook describes a dish called lagana that consisted of layers of dough with meat stuffing, an ancestor of modern-day lasagna.[11] However, the method of cooking these sheets of dough does not correspond to the modern definition of either a fresh or dry pasta product, which only had similar basic ingredients and perhaps the shape</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>

        <li>Pasta: You’ll need 8 ounces of pasta. I used penne, but I have more recommendations below!</li>

        <li>Chicken: Boneless skinless chicken breasts work well, but you can use thighs if you prefer. </li>

        <li>Extra virgin olive oil: I like our Nocellara Italian EVOO here. It smells and tastes like a summer afternoon in the garden, and pairs well with the other flavors in this dish. </li>

        <li>Dried oregano: For some earthiness. </li>
        <li>Garlic: Mince a few garlic cloves for a slightly spicy kick.</li>

        <li>Sun-dried tomatoes: Sun-dried tomatoes add a hint of sweetness and tang.</li>

        <li>Cherry or grape tomatoes: Toss them in whole! We don’t cook them down too much in this recipe, so they retain their shape and bright flavor.</li>

        <li>Artichoke hearts: Canned artichoke hearts add brininess, texture, and heft. </li>

        <li>Whole milk: Instead of heavy cream, we make a lighter sauce using whole milk. If you can’t tolerate dairy, try a creamy non-dairy alternative like cashew cream</li>

        <li>All-purpose flour: To thicken the sauce (see ideas below for gluten-free options).</li>

        <li>Parmesan cheese: Use a wedge or block of parmesan and grate it instead of buying the pre-grated kind from the store. Freshly grated parmesan melts much better. </li>

        <li>Baby spinach: We are using 2 cups, but the spinach will wilt down a lot.</li>

        <li>Fresh parsley: A generous sprinkle of fresh Italian parsley adds a pop of color and a fresh herbal element.</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Steps To Prepare</h4>

    <ol>

        <li>Add 8 ounces of penne pasta to a pot of salted boiling water and cook until al dente. Before draining, reserve about ½ cup of the pasta cooking water. </li>

        <li>Pasta water is key for a silky sauce: It acts as both an emulsifier and thickener, so the sauce can cling to the pasta.</li>

        <li>While the pasta cooks, pat dry 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts and slice them into strips or cubes. Season with kosher salt and black pepper to taste, and 2 teaspoons dried oregano.</li>

        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil in a large pan and add the chicken. Cook for 7 to 8 minutes, or until the chicken is done.</li>

        <li>To the same pan, add 3 minced garlic cloves and ¼ cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes and toss for 30 seconds or so, then add 1 cup whole cherry or grape tomatoes and a drained 15-ounce can of artichoke hearts. Toss and turn the heat to medium-low.</li>

        <li>Whisk together 1 cup whole milk, 2 tablespoons flour, and 1 cup grated parmesan cheese. Pour the mixture into the pan before adding 2 cups of baby spinach. Add 2 tablespoons of the pasta cooking water to the pan and stir to help the sauce thicken. You can add more pasta water if you need to. </li>

        <li>Add the cooked pasta and mix to combine. Add ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley and serve.</li>

    </ol>
